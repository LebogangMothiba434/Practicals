This repository contains my completed practicals from the **SQL Fundamentals** module of a Data Analytics course. These practicals were done using **Snowflake** and cover essential SQL concepts including basic syntax and JOINS.
Practical 1:
-Basic SQL Syntax
Practical 2:
-JOINS
By completing these two practicals, I gained hands-on experience with:
- Writing clean and effective SQL queries
- Querying and analyzing data in Snowflake
- Combining datasets using joins for richer insights
